I was part of the AI4ALL summer program in 2020 where I learned about basic concepts of AI and machine learning, how computer vision and NLP work at an introductory level. Iâ€™m excited to have more time and guidance in this program to learn more about various ML models and the appropriate use for each one. I hope to improve my Python programming skills and to gain the skills to be able to tackle future research projects.
