It was really inspiring to hear the stories of middle school and high school girls making a real impact on their community through their app that allows residents to make appointments for water distribution. During the first day, I learned how to use anaconda as opposed to pip to download libraries, and experimented with using Pycharm since I had previously used mostly Colab and Jupyter notebooks.

I have previously learned about the basic concepts of AI and machine learning, how computer vision and NLP work at an introductory level. I’m excited to have more time and guidance in this program to learn more about various ML models and the appropriate use for each one. I hope to improve my Python programming skills and to gain the skills to be able to tackle future research projects.

Dr. Kong showed us the power of storytelling with the videos and examples. They were so compelling and we were clearly moved to action. After his talk, I went through introspection to think of my own story. I’m still trying to dig deeper to find the true motivation for my passions for AI and health. It was such a privilege to be part of Dr. Kong’s leadership development session.

I learned about the steps of machine learning, the ML algorithm framework, and types of machine learning. The mentors gave great explanations and analogies to help us better understand the concepts. Previously, I hadn't known the difference between standardization (a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one [-1,1]) and normalization [0,1]. From Ms. Yohn, the scenarios of students feeling excluded and discussing solutions was helpful as a reminder. 

i. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

In supervised machine learning: the program fed labels that correspond with the training examples. When given new data, it is able to decide the classification based on the labeled training data. On the other hand, in unsupervised machine learning, the program is given no labels and a bunch of data. It must find patterns and relationships within the data and use clustering methods.

ii. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

SkiKit Learn provides supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms but not visualization methods. Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries are necessary to visualize the data.

Waste management is an issue in the US since most of the wastes end up in landfills. Eutrophication of lakes, consumption of toxic waste by animals, and land, water, air pollution are resulting problems. This dataset classifies household waste by Organic (O) and Recyclable (R). I would utilize the CNN deep learning model since neural networks are the best fit for image classification.

1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?

Tensors are multidimensional data arrays that neural networks can perform on. Plane vectors are a type of tensor in which there is a x,y coordinate system that a vector is plotted on. Covectors and linear operators are other types of tensors. I learned about ranks of tensors in N-dimension spaces and that tensors generally refer to a vector that is three or more dimensions. Tensors are used in Machine Learning with Tensorflow as the library does numerical computations on tensors. Tensors are the basic building blocks of modern machine learning. They can be thought of as a container storing arrays of data.


2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

I noticed that the images were different dimensions which is the reason preprocessing data to ensure all of them are the same length is important. It was interesting to experiment with the subplot function and see how the bar graph corresponded to the number of pictures of each type of sign (Label 1-61). I also encountered errors due to version differences. Most of the cells of code required transformation from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2, so I had to do a lot of googling of errors that resulted from the change.
