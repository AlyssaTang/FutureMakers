# FutureMakers Responses

## 7/6

I have previously learned about the basic concepts of AI and machine learning, how computer vision and NLP work at an introductory level. I’m excited to have more time and guidance in this program to learn more about various ML models and the appropriate use for each one. I hope to improve my Python programming skills and to gain the skills to be able to tackle future research projects.
