It was really inspiring to hear the stories of middle school and high school girls making a real impact on their community through their app that allows residents to make appointments for water distribution. During the first day, I learned how to use anaconda as opposed to pip to download libraries, and experimented with using Pycharm since I had previously used mostly Colab and Jupyter notebooks.

I have previously learned about the basic concepts of AI and machine learning, how computer vision and NLP work at an introductory level. I’m excited to have more time and guidance in this program to learn more about various ML models and the appropriate use for each one. I hope to improve my Python programming skills and to gain the skills to be able to tackle future research projects.

Dr. Kong showed us the power of storytelling with the videos and examples. They were so compelling and we were clearly moved to action. After his talk, I went through introspection to think of my own story. I’m still trying to dig deeper to find the true motivation for my passions for AI and health. It was such a privilege to be part of Dr. Kong’s leadership development session.
