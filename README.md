# FutureMakers Responses

## 7/6
It was really inspiring to hear the stories of middle school and high school girls making a real impact on their community through their app that allows residents to make appointments for water distribution. During the first day, I learned how to use anaconda as opposed to pip to download libraries, and experimented with using Pycharm since I had previously used mostly Colab and Jupyter notebooks.

I have previously learned about the basic concepts of AI and machine learning, how computer vision and NLP work at an introductory level. Iâ€™m excited to have more time and guidance in this program to learn more about various ML models and the appropriate use for each one. I hope to improve my Python programming skills and to gain the skills to be able to tackle future research projects.
